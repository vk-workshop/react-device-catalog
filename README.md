# React Device Catalog

## Project Overview

This project is a responsive phone catalog built with React. Users can browse a list of phones, view details for individual models, add items to their cart, and manage their favorites. The project demonstrates key features of a modern e-commerce application, including dynamic routing, state management, and interaction with mock data.
